## Legal, social and ethical considerations:


### Legal:

Issue:



* Intellectual theft through plagiarism and inability to declare usage of someone’s own work.
    * May result in copyright infringement and disputes surrounding intellectual property.

Solution:



* Intellectual theft can be addressed in my project through:
    * Thoroughly referencing any tutorials I have used to aid in the development of this project. 
    * These tutorials have been referenced using the APA 7 format to explicitly state their contributions to my project. 
    * This shouldn’t be a big issue as these YouTube tutorials and documentation guides serve the primary purpose of providing people with free access to information.


### Social:

Issue:



* Data breaching through accessing users information without their consent or approval.
    * May result in stakeholders losing trust in the software application and disassociating from it to ensure their own privacy.	

Solution:



* Data breaching can be addressed in my project through:
    * Declaring that the time and date information will be used in this project through the requirements file. 
    * This information isn't personal but some individuals may like to know what data is being accessed.


### Ethical:

Issue:



* Accessibility through disabilities that prevent users from properly navigating and using the application.
    * May result in certain users being ostracised from using the software application.

Solution:



* Accessibility can be addressed in my project through:
    * I have used big fonts and colour coding throughout my project to make sure buttons are easy to read and their purposes are well-defined.


## User interface design:


### Visual appeal:



* This project uses a modern design aesthetic, which uses simple, two-dimensional shapes to build the widgets and a simple, monotone colour palette.
    * This design aesthetic is widely used in the current software design and development landscape because it doesn’t require too much effort to replicate while still being minimalist and therefore aesthetically pleasing.
    * Furthermore, this design has a practical usage for stakeholders as well, as its simplicity allows for focus, where more outdated software solutions were mild sensory overloads due to the complexity of widget designs and colour palettes, distracting users.

Hence, for the aforementioned reasons, I have used modern software design principles to visually represent my application to prevent obsolescence.


### Consistency:



* This project has a consistent design philosophy, not deviating from previous design principles.
    * This has been achieved by using consistent widget and label padding between and within the sub-windows and main menu. 
    * Furthermore, I have made sure that the font stays consistent throughout the application, as well as the font size for titles and subtitles.

Hence, for the aforementioned reasons, I have made sure that my design is consistent to enhance its professional appearance and polish.


### Colour coding:



* This project uses colour coding to associate a certain colour with a certain function within the application.
    * This has been achieved primarily in the timer and stopwatch sub-windows, where the start, pause and stop are a designated colour, enhancing the usability and accessibility of this application.
    * Furthermore, this allows the application to be more organised. 

Hence, for the aforementioned reasons, I have made sure that colour coding has been a priority throughout my project to allow it to be readable and organised.


## Documentation:


### User documentation:



* User documentation assists in teaching stakeholders how to install and use the application.
    * I have achieved this through my READ markdown file, which clearly outlines the installation process using visual guidelines to explicitly educate the stakeholders on how to download and run the software solution.
    * Furthermore, I have also inserted instructions after the installation guide, outlining the simple functionalities of each button and therefore help users navigate through the application.


### Technical documentation:



* Technical documentation assists myself and the stakeholders on how the software application’s intended functionality.
    * My code employs detailed descriptions before each widget and function to detail how they function.
    * Furthermore, my journal in Part A elaborates upon each widget and function but more importantly outlines how the code has evolved over the development timeline. 
    * Minor technical documentation strategies also include my modelling diagram, which employs a visual representation of how the code is supposed to interact with the stakeholders inputs.


### Project documentation:



* Project documentation informs the stakeholders on how the software application has progressed and evolved since its initial inception last term. 
    * Through pre-implementation and post-implementation documentation, users are informed upon how this project has changed and evolved during the design process, reflectant of the influences of poor time management strategies within my project.
    * Furthermore, my Gantt chart reinforces my time management issues using a visual medium that is easy for stakeholders to interpret and scrutinise.


## AGILE method:


### Project management:



* The agile method has allowed me to focus on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through incremental improvements.
    * This is reflected in my usage of sprints, or in my case, blocks, which are short, time-boxed iterations which slowly deliver functional prototypes every few weeks.
    * Since these blocks are often quite small, they are easy to organise, allowing for easier identification of errors as reflected in my journal, particularly the two organisation entries.

Overall, this method has been beneficial in the development of my software solution due to its incremental but highly organised approach to project management.


### Collaboration:



* The agile method has allowed me to focus on collaborative effort, emphasising flexibility and customer feedback.
    * After every iteration, I made sure to demonstrate the new code’s functionality to collaborators and stakeholders to gather feedback and improve the application for future sprints.
    * This allowed for a greater variety of opinions upon different aspects of the project, enabling issues to be resolved early on.

Overall, this method has been beneficial in the development of my software solution due to its emphasis upon the importance of collaboration to critique a project and ultimately improve its functionality.


## Communication:


### Commenting:



* I have used commenting in my project’s code file to clearly communicate to stakeholders how each widget has been customised and how each function operates.
    * I made sure to clearly describe the widgets and functions in detail, often spanning one or two full sentences. 
* Furthermore, I employed the journal to elaborate upon the widgets but more importantly the functions, segmenting each of them into their individual statements to better explain their usage to the stakeholders.


### Visualisation tools:



* I have used visualisation tools, primarily the Gantt chart and modelling diagram to allow the stakeholder’s to visualise the development process and the final product. 
    * Visual aids are often more explicit and easier to understand than words, making them useful in communicating ideas, especially if the stakeholder isn’t particularly qualified or experienced in software development.


### Code reviews:



* I have asked for code reviews from colleagues and stakeholders to help identify any further issues by collating numerous perspectives.
    * This process promotes collaborative development to help ensure code quality and early squashing of bugs.
* Furthermore, this enables the sharing of knowledge between myself and the stakeholder to learn from each other’s coding practices and approaches.
