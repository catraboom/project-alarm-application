### Direct reflection:



* Although I heavily simplified this project, I was able to finish the application to a satisfactory level that meets the requirements I set out to complete. 
* Firstly, Block A held my most successful progress on the project.
    * The basics were fairly easy to implement using the CustomTkinter documentation guide, consisting of a few basic widgets, setting the basis for my project.
    * The refinements that followed helped make the project more visually appealing, shaping the aesthetic considerations of the application as a whole.
    * The settings sub-window was the first window developed as it was the most straightforward and allowed me to experiment with simple functions, setting the standard for following features.
    * The timer was the next sub-window implemented also due to its simplicity, however it enhanced my understanding of the basics of counting time in python, which was integral in the development of subsequent sub-windows.
    * This block had many easy elements that allowed me to finish it relatively quickly.
* Next, Block B revealed the issues evident in my code but allowed me to fix them.
    * I first followed my plan of integrating more sub-windows by developing the Stopwatch’s GUI. However, the lack of organisation evident in my code resulted in the logic I tried to consequently develop for the stopwatch to fail, marking the first major issue of the project’s evolution.
    * Hence, I took initiative to organise my code by reorganising sections and understanding any choke points that had to be edited to ensure readability and efficiency. This aided my critical perception of issues, improving upon my problem solving skills.
    * This deviation from the plan proved to be successful, as I was able to identify various bugs that prevented me from progressing into the stopwatch’s logic. This developed my awareness of organising code and how it enables easier recognition of errors, evident in subsequent journal entries.
    * After completing the stopwatch’s logic, at this point I finally realised that I needed to delete the more features segment of the project, a major but vital deviation from the plan that allowed me to complete the application in the allotted time. 
    * Then I went back to creating sub-windows, this time with the alarm, which was more complicated than the previous features and therefore required more time to complete. However, thanks to my previous organisation I didn’t run into any major problems when developing the logic despite its added complexity.
    * Although stressful at times, this block made me more aware of the problems coders face in software development and the steps I can take to solve them.
* Lastly, Block C was fairly straightforward in terms of development.
    * By using Tkinter’s libraries and the calendar module within it, I was able to create an intuitive and easily navigable calendar application which met all my requirements.
    * By finishing all the major elements of the application, I still had to thoroughly edit the repositories to squash bugs and optimise existing code. 
    * Aesthetics were slowly beginning to be neglected in some areas as the development progressed, so I quickly decided to address them through reorganising and editing widgets, enhancing the visual consistency of the application.
    * Next, I went back to code organisation, this time with the intent to streamline the project through the renaming widgets and variables to make their functions more clear, improving the repositories readability.
    * I decided to save the main menu’s background colour, specified by the user in the settings sub-window, allowing the user to more easily personalise the application.
    * The most important consideration, bug fixing, was left at the end so that all the major bugs I had accumulated could be fixed. Although tedious, I was able to squash all the bugs whilst optimising the application, improving the usability and user experience.
    * Although uneventful, this block was important in concluding the project’s development by fixing long-standing aesthetic issues and bugs.

I am satisfied with the development of this project, disappointed that I didn’t have the drive to start this project early, seen in my neglection of more features. Either way, I was able to implement all my important features and create a product that essentially combined all major time management approaches into one holistic application. 


### Modifications/Deviations:



* The major deviation in this project was my neglectance of the more features section of this application.
    * This was a useful alteration as it allowed me to complete the project in the allotted time period.
    * Furthermore, the neglectance didn’t affect the usefulness of this application as a whole, as many of these extra features would essentially serve as gimmicks, which stakeholders will deem unnecessary.
    * Considering the time it would’ve taken to implement all of these features, it isn’t worth it for gimmicks that most likely would be full of bugs due their relative complexities. 
* Another deviation was the removal of cascading menus.
    * I feel like these overcomplicate the functionality of this product and the simple buttons clearly convey to users how to navigate through the application.
    * If I integrated the more features aforementioned, maybe the cascading menu could be useful.

These two deviations modified my project in a way that allowed it to be completed in the allotted time, making them valid and therefore essential if I was ever going to finish the application to a satisfactory standard.
